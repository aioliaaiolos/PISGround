NOTE:
- The WSDL files generated by the GenerateWSDL.bat batch file are encoded in UTF-8 with BOM (Byte Order Mark).  

- The XSD files generated by the GenerateWSDL.bat batch file do not include the "schemaLocation" attribute for the "import" element. 

In order to import thoses in SoapUI, the following modifications should be done:
- Save each files (WSDL, XSD) in UTF-8 without BOM (can use Notepad++ for doing that).
- Add the "schemaLocation=filename.xsd" attribute for each "import" element.
